//snake Game will be responsible for holding the snake and apple objects
//updating the states of the objects 
//drawing from the draw caches and erasing from the erase caches 

//snake will have its own draw cache and erase cache 
//so will apple 

//these ideas will be enforced through game objects with a virtual function draw_cache, and erase_cache
//Color coord data types will be the new input for draw function
